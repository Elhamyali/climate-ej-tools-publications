Please find the original raw datasets in the data folder for reference.\n\n## Analysis\n\nI will look at each question one by one and clean the data as I go. Some datasets might need to be combined, so I will organize the data during the analysis before exploring the results.\n\n### Load packages and libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ## For folder structure\n# library(here)\n# library(ezknitr)\n# \n# ## For data import/cleaning\n# library(tidyverse)\n# library(purrr)\n# library(rlang)\n# library(forcats)\n# library(readxl)\n# \n# ## For graphing\n# library(highcharter)\n# library(igraph)\n# library(RColorBrewer)\n# library(htmlwidgets)\n# library(gt)\n# # library(viridis)\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
